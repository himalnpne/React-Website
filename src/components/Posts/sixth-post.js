      text: "Pendrives are among the most counterfeited storage devices in the market. Many claim high capacities like 128GB or 256GB but internally contain far less memory, relying on firmware tricks to fake the size. These drives appear normal until data starts disappearing or getting corrupted. In this article, we'll walk through reliable methods to test pendrive authenticity, covering capacity verification, speed checks, controller behavior, and physical inspection—similar to how SSDs and HDDs are validated."

      text: "Fake pendrives are profitable because NAND flash prices scale sharply with capacity. Unscrupulous sellers reprogram the USB controller to report a higher capacity than physically present—for example, a 16GB chip pretending to be 128GB. Operating systems trust the controller, so the drive looks legitimate until real usage exposes the truth. These fakes are common in marketplaces, local shops, and even bundled giveaways."
