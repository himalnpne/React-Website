They might come with limits like less data or fewer servers, but they're awesome for casual use or if you're just testing the waters. The VPNs I'm covering work on all your devices—Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS—so you're covered no matter what you're using."

      text: "Proton VPN, from the creators of ProtonMail, is a standout because it offers unlimited data on its free plan—pretty rare! Based in Switzerland, it's a privacy powerhouse with a no-logs policy and AES-256 encryption. The free tier limits you to servers in five countries (US, Netherlands, Japan, Romania, Poland), no server choice, and just one device connection."

      text: "Sadly, torrenting isn't an option on the free plan since P2P is blocked. It's better for secure browsing or occasional streaming (like US Netflix, if you're lucky). Speeds are solid, with about a 13% drop. It runs smoothly on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, making it a great pick if privacy's your priority."

It supports P2P on all 10+ free servers (think US, Canada, UK), offers 10GB of monthly data (or 15GB if you tweet about them), and delivers fast speeds—around 6.3MiB/s for torrents. You can connect unlimited devices, and it comes with cool extras like a kill switch, an ad blocker called R.O.B.E.R.T., and AES-256 encryption."

      text: "Cloudflare WARP isn't your typical VPN—it's more like a super-fast, secure tunnel that's great for bypassing censorship. With unlimited data and minimal speed loss (under 4% in my tests), it's ideal for accessing blocked sites. The downside? You can't pick your server location, so it's not great for pretending you're in a specific country."

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Torrenting with WARP is iffy since it's not designed for P2P. It's better for quick, secure access to restricted content. The app is lightweight and works like a charm on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS."

Windscribe steals the show with its torrent-friendly servers, kill switch, and no-logs policy to keep DMCA notices at bay. Proton VPN's free plan doesn't support torrents, and WARP's P2P performance is unreliable. For heavy torrenting, you might want to consider a paid VPN for unlimited data and more server options."

Cloudflare WARP is all about speed and dodging censorship, though it's not great for location spoofing or consistent torrenting. All three work on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, so you're set on any device."
